Maze Race is a classic maze game with the twist of you racing against the computer.


The objective is to reach the finish tile (orange) first, located at the bottom right. Both the player and the computer start at the most upper-left tile (green).


For input, the player must swipe in the direction they want to move to.


The difficulty can be set through the size of the maze in the main screen.


Enjoy the game and good luck!
